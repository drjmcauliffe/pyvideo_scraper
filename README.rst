PyVideo Scraper
===============================

Building on the `Gist of Miguel Grinberg`_ and merging with my own fork of Nick Facano's `pytube`_ I've hacked this together to scan `pyvideo.org`_ pages and download the video content from youtube.

To get going grab my fork of `pytube`_ (it's been slightly modified to have a non-verbose mode) run python setup.py install in the pylab directory and then all you have to do is download this repo - it doesn't need to be installed...

Features
--------

* TODO: Fix this repo with proper tests and documentation.
* TODO: Generalise the scirpt to also 'search' youtube and download the results.
